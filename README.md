4. **"Chain not supported"**
   - Verify chain is in supported_chains list
   - Check chain configuration in multi_chain_executor.py
   - Ensure RPC URL is correct

5. **"Token already held"**
   - The bot prevents buying the same token multiple times
   - This is a safety feature to avoid concentration risk
   - Wait for the position to close before buying again

6. **"Insufficient balance"**
   - The bot checks wallet balance before trading
   - Includes gas fee buffer to prevent failed transactions
   - Consider reducing trade amount or adding more funds

7. **"Token delisted"**
   - The bot automatically detects delisted tokens
   - Sends Telegram alert with loss amount
   - Removes from active monitoring
   - Logs as "delisted" trade with 100% loss

8. **"Price fetch failed"**
   - Check RPC endpoint connectivity
   - Verify token address is correct
   - May indicate token is delisted or has no liquidity
   - Bot will automatically handle after 5 consecutive failures

9. **"Jupiter price API error: nodename nor servname provided"**
   - **FIXED**: This error has been resolved in v2.6
   - The bot now uses reliable `quote-api.jup.ag` and CoinGecko instead of deprecated `price.jup.ag`
   - If you see this error, update to the latest version
   - The bot automatically falls back to multiple price sources for reliability

10. **"Bot running for 10+ hours with no trades"**
    - **FIXED**: This critical issue has been resolved in v2.9
    - The pre-buy delisting check was incorrectly blocking ALL new tokens due to SOL price API failures
    - Solana tokens were being marked as "delisted" because Jupiter API calls were failing
    - The strategy now trusts DexScreener data for Solana tokens with good volume/liquidity
    - Update to the latest version to fix this issue
    - The bot now properly distinguishes between delisted tokens and new tokens

11. **"All Solana tokens marked as delisted"**
    - **FIXED**: This issue has been resolved in v2.9
    - Jupiter API parameter errors were causing all price validation to fail
    - CoinGecko rate limiting was preventing SOL price fetching
    - The bot now uses volume/liquidity thresholds for Solana token evaluation
    - Update to the latest version to fix this issue

12. **"Jupiter quote failed (attempt 1/3): 400"**
    - **CURRENT ISSUE**: Jupiter API is rejecting quote requests with 400 errors
    - **Causes**: Invalid token addresses, insufficient liquidity, API parameter validation issues
    - **Workaround**: Bot allows tokens to proceed despite Jupiter validation issues
    - **Solution**: Focus on Ethereum trading until Jupiter API issues are resolved
    - **Status**: Being investigated and fixed

13. **"Could not get SOL price from any source"**
    - **CURRENT ISSUE**: All SOL price APIs (CoinGecko, Jupiter, DexScreener) are failing
    - **Causes**: Rate limiting, API downtime, network connectivity issues
    - **Workaround**: Bot uses fallback price when all sources fail
    - **Solution**: Enhanced fallback mechanisms and alternative price sources
    - **Status**: Being improved with better error handling

14. **"Configuration not reloading"**
    - **FIXED**: This issue has been resolved in v3.2
    - **Cause**: Python modules were loading config at import time and caching values
    - **Solution**: Implemented dynamic configuration loading with `config_loader.py`
    - **Result**: Changes to `config.yaml` now take effect immediately without restart
    - **Status**: ✅ Resolved with automatic cache clearing

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 🔐 Secrets Management
1. **Use secure secrets backends** - AWS Secrets Manager, encrypted local files, or environment variables
2. **Never store private keys in plain text** - Avoid `.env` files for production
3. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Update private keys and API tokens periodically
4. **Use dedicated trading wallets** - Separate from main wallets
5. **Limit wallet permissions** - Only grant necessary permissions

### 🛡️ Trading Security
6. **Start with small amounts** - Test with minimal funds first
7. **Monitor the bot regularly** - Check for unusual activity
8. **Set appropriate wallet balance buffers** - Configure `min_wallet_balance_buffer` to reserve funds for gas
9. **Monitor position concentration** - The bot prevents duplicate buys, but monitor overall portfolio diversity
10. **Understand delisting risks** - Meme tokens can be delisted quickly, resulting in 100% loss
11. **Monitor position alerts** - Pay attention to Telegram notifications for position updates

### 🔧 Infrastructure Security
12. **Regularly update dependencies** - Keep all packages updated
13. **Test on testnets first** - Validate functionality before mainnet
14. **Use hardware wallets for large amounts** - Consider hardware wallets for significant funds
15. **Secure wallet setup** - Use separate wallets for different networks (MetaMask for ETH/Base, Phantom for Solana)
16. **Backup secrets securely** - Store backup credentials in secure locations
17. **Monitor access logs** - Track who has access to your secrets

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Solana Import Errors
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'solana.keypair'`

**Solution**: Install the correct Solana version:
```bash
pip uninstall solana -y
pip install solana==0.27.0
```

**Why**: Newer versions of the Solana package (0.30+) removed the `keypair` module, which is required for the bot's pre-buy delisting checks.

#### 2. Delisted Token Still Bought
**Issue**: Token appears "delisted" in logs but gets bought anyway

**Explanation**: 
- "Delisted" messages in discovery logs indicate tokens with zero liquidity, not actual delisting
- If pre-buy delisting check fails due to missing dependencies, the bot defaults to allowing the trade
- Check if Solana dependencies are properly installed

**Solution**: Ensure Solana dependencies are correct and pre-buy checks are working

#### 3. Pre-Buy Delisting Check Failures
**Error**: `⚠️ Pre-buy check failed for [TOKEN]: No module named 'solana.keypair'`

**Solution**: Fix Solana dependencies as shown above

**Impact**: Without proper delisting checks, the bot may buy tokens that are actually delisted or inactive

#### 4. SSL Warnings
**Warning**: `NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+`

**Solution**: This is a warning and doesn't affect functionality. For production, consider updating OpenSSL or using a different Python environment.

#### 5. Secrets Management Issues
**Error**: `❌ Missing required secrets`

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Set up secrets interactively
python setup_secrets.py

# Or migrate from existing .env
python setup_secrets.py migrate
```

**Error**: `❌ Error accessing AWS Secrets Manager`

**Solution**: 
- Ensure AWS CLI is configured: `aws configure`
- Check IAM permissions for Secrets Manager
- Verify AWS region matches your configuration

**Error**: `⚠️ Encryption not available for local secrets`

**Solution**: Install cryptography package:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Dependency Issues

#### Solana Package Version Conflicts
The bot requires specific Solana package versions:
- ✅ `solana==0.27.0` (includes `keypair` module)
- ❌ `solana>=0.30.0` (missing `keypair` module)

#### Installation Verification
Test Solana dependencies:
```bash
python -c "import solana.keypair; print('✅ Solana keypair module working')"
```

### Performance Issues

#### High Gas Fees
- Use Base network for lower fees
- Adjust `min_wallet_balance_buffer` to ensure sufficient gas
- Monitor gas prices before trading

#### Slow Token Discovery
- Check RPC endpoint connectivity
- Verify API rate limits
- Consider using paid RPC providers for production
